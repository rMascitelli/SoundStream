# Master Branch - SoundStream 

A simple app for streaming music. For now, royalty-free WAVs are being used. 

Sprints for this project:

1) Finish download-based model first 
2) Re-write client to use Python + requests library (C++ REST requests are complex and finnicky to work with. Will finish this later.)
3) Convert back-end to use Golang and Nginx to allow RTMP streaming
4) Convert monolithic app to microservice model using Kubernetes (for scalability)
