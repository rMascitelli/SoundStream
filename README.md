# Master Branch - SoundStream 

A simple app for streaming music. For now, royalty-free WAVs are being used. 

Sprints for this project:

1) Finish download-based model first 
2) Convert back-end to use Golang and Nginx to allow RTMP streaming
3) Convert monolithic app to microservice model using Kubernetes (for scalability)
